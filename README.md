# Weighted-Information-Criteria (WIC)
Weighted Information Criteria (WIC) is used for finding optimal model order penalizing overfitting of model for a wide range of model order given signal snapshots. Use the script "wic.m".

# Minimum Description Length (MDL), also known as Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is used when the ratio m/k is low where m = number of signal snapshots, k = number of freely adjusted parameter. Use the script "bic.m".
